The secret to getting ahead is getting started.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
You are never to old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
The will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success.
What people say is a reflection of them not you.
What you think of yourself is much more important than what people think of you.
Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.
The Only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it, keep looking. Don't Settle.
Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.
He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.
