I will not provide any support.

# UPDATE

> Still works as of 5/6/2023 
> Got reports saying that sometimes it doesnt show anything and it just takes all ur balance, It's not a problem with the gen its problem with `capsolver.com`. Although It only does that rarely so its safe to use

# SHITTY SOLVER

> A few days ago, it returned that capsolver doesn't support kasada anymore. Although I think they are re-adding it everytime they update or something, I don't know. Anyways, Make sure to debug with one thread before using it..
